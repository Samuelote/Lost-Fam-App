# Lost Fam App
By Sam Wood and Chadwick Platt-Kuhn


Original idea proposed by Kent Johns and Michael Graeff

This is an attempt to recreate the experience that comes with shooting film. The user creates rolls with a fixed length. The photos you take under that roll cannot be reproduced/viewed until the whole roll is finished. All the photos in said album are "developed" and viewed all at once. Roll can then be saved and ordered.

## CURRENT TO DO LIST


- add photo filter options. https://github.com/gre/gl-react/blob/master/README.md

- NEED TO LINK THESE LIBRARIES
  - add stripe
