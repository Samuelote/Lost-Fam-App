# Lost Fam App
By Sam Wood and Chadwick Platt-Kuhn


Original idea proposed by Kent Johns and Michael Graeff

This is an attempt to recreate the expirience that comes with shooting film. The user creates rolls with a fixed length. The photos you take under that roll cannot be reproduced/viewed until the whole roll is finished. All the photos in said album are "developed" and viewed all at once.
