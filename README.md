# Lost Fam App
By Sam Wood and @chdwck


Original idea proposed by Kent Johns and Michael Graeff.

iOS compatable. Android, no promises.


This is an attempt to recreate the experience that comes with shooting film. The user creates rolls with a fixed length. The photos you take under that roll cannot be reproduced/viewed until the whole roll is finished. All the photos in said roll are "developed" and viewed all at once. The roll can then be saved and ordered.
