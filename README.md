# Lost Fam App
By Sam Wood and @chdwck


Original idea proposed by Kent Johns and Michael Graeff.


This is an attempt to recreate the experience that comes with shooting film. The user creates rolls with a fixed length. The photos you take under that roll cannot be reproduced/viewed until the whole roll is finished. All the photos in said roll are "developed" and viewed all at once. The roll can then be saved and ordered.
